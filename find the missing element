ProblemÂ¶
Consider an array of non-negative integers. A second array is formed by shuffling the elements of the first array and deleting a random element. Given these two arrays, find which element is missing in the second array.

Here is an example input, the first array is shuffled and the number 5 is removed to construct the second array.

Input:

finder([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[3,7,2,1,4,6])

Output:

5 is the missing number


#Brute force 
def finder(arr1,arr2):
    arr1.sort()
    arr2.sort()
    for i in range(len(arr1)):
        if arr1[i] == arr2[i]:
            continue
        else:
            return arr[i]
            
            
finder([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[3,7,2,1,4,6])
